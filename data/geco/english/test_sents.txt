There were no red eyes, no signs of secretly indulged grief.
Associate it more with a man."
"But the evidence is so conclusive."
"No, my friend, there was a moment when you were not all together.

"Did you not know it?"
"She made us come right in, and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper...under paper...under where she'd signed."
He would call evidence to show who did destroy the will, and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case.
Ever since the early hours of the morning, John had been hard at work, sending telegrams...one of the first had gone to Evelyn Howard...writing notices for the papers, and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails.
"It might have been salt," replied Poirot placidly.
"And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice?
She married him without love.
I had had no opportunity as yet of passing on Poirot's message to Lawrence.
"No, but I deny your right to criticize my actions.
We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door.
"Because, mon ami, it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence.
But it should be done...at once!"
I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred.
'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.'
It must have been got quite lately, I think.
No, we must look elsewhere.
Poirot waited for her indignation to subside, and then, resuming his business-like tone, he asked: "Now, as to this quarrel?
"Oh, of course...that goes without saying."
"You've heard me speak of Mr. Poirot?

So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman......" "I will tell him, Dorcas," I promised.
Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper?
For, see you, it is a big stake for which I play.
Officially, I have nothing to do with it.
Mr. Wells was a pleasant man of middle-age, with keen eyes, and the typical lawyer's mouth.
She is so very violent.
The war was momentarily inactive, and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life: "The Mysterious Affair at Styles" was the topic of the moment.
Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself."
It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and I found one or two snipped hairs.
"Poirot," I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I dragged him into the room.
On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it.
There isn't one of them that's not hard up and trying to get money out of her.
I put them to you with Mr. Cavendish's full approval."
At 4 o'clock she has been angry, but completely mistress of herself.
I was anxious to get hold of John, but he was nowhere to be seen.
I will mount to my room."
"That was very ingenious," I could not help admitting.
To my extreme annoyance, Poirot was not in, and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London.
You'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman today perhaps?"
Good-bye, you've cheered me up very much."
One was to Miss Howard, and one was to Mr. Wells, the lawyer, and the other two I don't think I remember, sir...oh, yes, one was to Ross's, the caterers in Tadminster.
Then, do you remember 'Baron' Altara?
He turned up from nowhere, on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie's, though she didn't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship.
But this, as we know, is what happened.
It puzzled me, for I saw no occasion for it.
And have you not, in such a case, tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper, or a spare scrap of paper, to see if it looked right?
It must have been made just at the time they were engaged.
"This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death.
It really is too bad!
"Enough to make a man morbid, to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots, wherever he goes!
He had a candle in his hand, and the agitation of his face told me at once that something was seriously wrong.
There was a faint insolence in her voice.
But he was very upset.
Still beaming, Poirot marshalled us all into the drawing-room, bringing forward chairs as he did so.
"Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then?"
Could the strychnine have been administered in that?"
"I should like to see them!"
We went slowly down the stairs.
But the flesh is weak, it is consolation to find that one is on the right track.
He retrieved it, and buried it neatly.
"It's almost too hot," she murmured.
It is enough for me that it is as I thought.
"I understand, mademoiselle, I understand all you feel.
Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp's stony denials!"
It was most easy for her.
Should have remembered it if it was."

This Mr. Inglethorp, I should say, is somewhat of a scoundrel...but that does not of necessity make him a murderer."
"You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins, I believe?"
An old woman came and opened it.
At the same time, it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected.
Does the next fit in with that?
She began slowly, walking up and down the room, her head a little bent, and that slim, supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked.
"Nor anyone else in the house?"
"He's a dear little man," said Cynthia.
"Yes, John likes me, I think, and of course Evie, for all her gruff ways, wouldn't be unkind to a fly.
This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly, and to whose warning I had, alas, paid no heed!
She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty, with a deep voice, almost manly in its stentorian tones, and had a large sensible square body, with feet to match...these last encased in good thick boots.
In the general confusion, the boudoir had not been swept that morning, and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth.
"I really do not remember hearing anything."
Poirot looked at him thoughtfully.
In fact, I was convinced that, far from having been in her own room, Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased's room when the alarm was given."
For the first time I felt that, with Evelyn Howard, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere.
Mrs. Cavendish, who had married John's father when he was a widower with two sons, had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her.
"Yes, but I don't see......"
If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return, and seen it there, it would have been a valuable point in his favour.
Do not forget that, my friend.
"No, you are right," he said, "it is not as though there was a blood tie.
For Poirot, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry, again annihilated his masterpiece of cards, and putting his hands over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards, apparently suffering the keenest agony.
He was a good fifteen years my senior, for one thing, though he hardly looked his forty-five years.
His voice was rather deep and unctuous.
As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in, I drew nearer, and was introduced to Detective-Inspector Japp, who, in his turn, introduced us both to his companion, Superintendent Summerhaye.
I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on disconnectedly: "There were no stamps in his desk, but there might have been, eh, mon ami?
The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation, and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily.
"No, I can't say that I do."
On Monday, therefore, at six o'clock, Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village.
She answered quietly: "I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles."
As for me, I was literally dumb with astonishment.
Cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me."
Strychnine is, in a certain sense, a cumulative poison, but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way.
"It is certainly curious," I agreed.
Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife.
"Miss Murdoch too," I continued, "there's nothing untruthful about her."
asked a voice behind me, and I turned to find Mary Cavendish at my elbow.
"He is a clever man, that Sir Ernest."
"My dear friend, do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again?
The boom of the gong sounded from the house, and we went in together.
Sir Ernest Heavywether made short work of her, and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly, and Sir Ernest sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face.
I can't think what they're after!
But not a penny piece besides...not besides...not a pair of gloves, nor a theatre ticket.'
Lawrence Cavendish was then put into the box.
It has to be examined...sifted.
After tea will do quite well.
Poirot shook his head energetically.
I had rejected it as absurd, nevertheless it persisted.
'Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing, Dorcas.
Now, will you send Annie to me here?"
I stared at the two men intently.
"These evenings must have been great fun," said Poirot genially.
I have certain little ideas of my own about that will.
His words took me back to earlier events.
"And neither of them is for you?"
"You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand, and left large clear spaces between her words.
Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp's guilt.
A 'man of method' was, in Poirot's estimation, the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual.
Poirot nodded, as if satisfied.
For it is of the most complicated!
But I decided that if I made any interesting and important discoveries...as no doubt I should...I would keep them to myself, and surprise Poirot with the ultimate result.
"Ah, that I will leave you to find out.
"We do not agree, eh?"
I gathered from the little nurse's expression that there was not the least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded 'Sister'.
"You were going to say......?"
Dr. Bauerstein remained in the background, his grave bearded face unchanged.
"Mon ami, have you ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word?"
I found her leaning against the bannisters, deadly pale.
"Yes, it is Mrs. Inglethorp's.
"It's an awkward position for all of us.
"He looked a regular scarecrow!
Then I thought I heard them coming out, so I went off quickly."
Of course, it was all a bad dream.
Sunday morning wore away, and still he did not reappear.
Evelyn Howard had been right in her facts, though her animosity against Alfred Inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned.
Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was watching the local doctor narrowly.
"Hydro-chloride of strychnine," he said, over his shoulder, continuing to hum.
"She was," said John unexpectedly.
That would be too good a farce!
Still, we can but try."
Summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical, but Japp continued his scrutiny of Poirot.
But Dorcas, who was the next witness called, dispelled even that possibility.
kissed first me and then Poirot, and rushed out of the room again.
"You are not ill, I trust?"
You would inherit it, wouldn't you?"
There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead.
My idea was...a very ridiculous one, no doubt...that she had intended to poison him...and that, in some way, Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake.
She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy.
But a heavy meal, taken at about the same time as the poison, might retard its effects, though hardly to that extent.
Sir Ernest Heavywether, who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses, only asked two questions.
"The swing door is in the left wing, is it not?"
The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant.
"Yes, sir, but that's always bolted.
Lady Tadminster's sister, you know.
They have no communication with the right wing, where the Inglethorps' rooms were situated.
"What a lot of bottles!"
I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call "Cynthia" impatiently, and the girl started and ran back to the house.
I really did not know how much Poirot would wish me to disclose.
Thus it came about that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no apparent reason for existence, perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes.
It's a good thing Styles wasn't the mater's to leave to him.
"My mother, at the time of her death, and for some time before it, was taking a tonic containing strychnine."
Poirot stared at me in surprise.
So he goes out and walks in the woods, little dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk, and discover the incriminating document.
"Why do you say that?"
"If you mean that I was fond of her...yes, I was.
"Who took it to her room?"
With Poirot away, I was uncertain how to act.
Mrs. Inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her, but I imagined that John and Mary would probably insist on her making her home with them...at any rate until the end of the war.
The weather had broken, and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness.
1 I should say, are a man's finger-prints; thumb and first finger.
"The drugged cocoa, taken on top of the poisoned coffee, amply accounts for the delay."
That salt on the tray, what else could it have been?"
I seemed to see her for a moment as she was, a proud wild creature, as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills.
One, a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder; two, a despatch-case with a key in the lock; three, a stain on the floor."
And, subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide, was quite unthinkable, Mr. Philips sat down and wiped his forehead.
He says: "Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!"
She was a most generous woman, and possessed a considerable fortune of her own.
It was in 1904 he and I worked together...the Abercrombie forgery case...you remember, he was run down in Brussels.
Inglethorp shook his head sadly.
The Coroner did not trouble to reply.
In a few moments, Alfred Inglethorp had ushered the doctor in, the latter laughing, and protesting that he was in no fit state for a drawing-room.
But by chance...there might be...let us see!"
She is like pictures I have seen in Italy.
"But I still don't see how he managed to prove his alibi, and yet go to the chemist's shop?"

Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation.
"Whether to catch the criminal or not?"
For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it.
knowing what I have now told you, do you still refuse to say where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon?" With a
"I want you to let me call him in...to investigate this matter."
Mr. Poirot, here, will show me the way."
Again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion.
Here is the analyst's report.
Though I did not acknowledge it to myself, the thought of Mary Cavendish was weighing on me.
"That was for a reason.
Cynthia Murdoch was just coming in, and Poirot stood aside to let her pass.
Every fact that I know is in your possession.
As waves his hands when he talks?
"Then you think he never really cared for her?"
I could not help laughing.
Afraid I said some things to Emily she won't forget or forgive in a hurry.
I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia.
He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe.
We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage, and proceeded up the now familiar stairs.
I didn't know as there was a beard up there at all.
Yes"...his eyes wandered round the room..."this boudoir has nothing more to tell us. It did
And that little curious fact, that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally, we put it here!"
Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th.
"In clearing Alfred Inglethorp," continued Poirot, "I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended.
I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way."
It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word 'possessed' that afternoon, and, having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind, the possibility of a will...(a document almost certain to contain that word)...occurred to me at once.
"I...only wanted to tell you something......" "Yes?"
Never, I thought, had his indecision of character been more apparent.
"They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish, by buying strychnine at the village chemist's, and signing the register in his hand-writing.
Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for: "You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested?"
Only a lunatic, who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged, would act so!"
We've got all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard.
Deftly, on hands and knees, he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender, handling them with the greatest caution.
In case of a refusal, Lady Tadminster might open it the first day, and Mrs. Crosbie the second.
"No, sir...not that I know of."
It worried me just a little, for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come.
But did every one suspect him?
But she was very good to us Belgians...I owe her a debt."
Still, there it is, we were in the wrong, and now there's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends; which is difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bit better than one did before.
"Yes, sir, and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron."
John practiced for some time as a barrister, but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire.
did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words?"
He looks round, and he sees...what do you think, mon ami?"
"What would she be likely to do with it afterwards?"
And the one on the tray?"
That is so, is it not?"
"I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he was Shah of Persia?"
It's double Dutch to me."
I could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope.
"I don't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John," I remarked.
"Say something original," groaned Cynthia.
As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him, the criminal would be off his guard.
"Mesdames and messieurs," said Poirot, bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture, "I have asked you to come here all together, for a certain object.
"That's a bargain," said Japp heartily.
He said it was to poison a dog."
you going to do now? Where are
"When did you first suspect John Cavendish?"
With the exception of Cynthia Murdoch's, every one's room was in this left wing.
"Your mother, you tell me, had a violent quarrel with...some one yesterday afternoon......" "What do you mean?"
A quick movement on his part, and his assailant fell with a crash.
As we entered, however, her limbs relaxed, and she fell back upon the pillows.
I am not a vain man where women are concerned, but I remembered certain evidences, too lightly thought of at the time, perhaps, but which certainly seemed to indicate...... My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Miss Howard.
If you are convinced he did it," said Poirot quietly.
But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp's keys would open it."
He slid back the roll top, and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers.
I said it quite quietly.
Quickest way to get here."
A man followed her, a suggestion of deference in his manner.
But excuse me, Mrs. Cavendish, although you realized it was a private conversation, you did not move away?
As far as we know, she was quite alone during that half-hour.
Mrs. Inglethorp came down last.
"I must say I think you might have given me a hint."
I think he suspected that Mary Cavendish could tell more if she chose.
From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him, and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.
I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement.
"Manning," said John, "this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer."
"Why, Cynthia, you are late today.
"She meant," replied Poirot promptly, "that she found it on top of a wardrobe."
In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon."
But it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make."
He held up the same dusty piece which Poirot and I had examined in the morning-room at Styles.
Yes, it was a clever idea!
Poirot nodded thoughtfully, like a man whose mind is made up.
The contents of the waste-paper-basket waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case, are sure to be examined.
There was no time for more.
Then Poirot repeated the question he had put to Dorcas: "Did your mistress ever have a green dress?"
No, I see nothing unusual."
To begin with, whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp's death, her husband would benefit the most.
The will disappears, and she takes its secret with her to her grave.
I am certain that you would find it.
With a nervous giggle, Annie took herself creakingly out of the room.
She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days.
"But possibly this is an old will?"
"Yes, but it was possible."
This is my specially sharpened scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displeased with you!'
"No, I don't think I shall.
Still frowning, he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards.
Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly.
Sounded as to the possibility of suicide, he repudiated it utterly.
That will give us plenty of time for the doctor's report.
Come on, let's have tea.
We have given up late dinner for some time now.
Poirot gave me a curious look, which I could not quite fathom.
Cavendish, I much fear there is no coincidence there.
"It was bad enough before, when we thought he'd done it, but I'm hanged if it isn't worse now, when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow.
As we turned in at the lodge gates, John said: "I'm afraid you'll find it very quiet down here, Hastings."
not yet a chance...we must leave no stone unturned..." He rushed like a madman from the room, and I followed him as soon as I had sufficiently recovered my wits.
At 4.30, Mrs. Inglethorp, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills, makes a will in favour of her husband, which the two gardeners witness.
Can't keep even with 'em.
"Why, that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned.
Then, as I looked at him inquiringly: "Yes, my friend, she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who, alas, are refugees from their native land.
"There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon."
Dorcas answered it in due course.
"Between Aunt Emily and him.
I asked her if she were feeling ill, and she answered frankly: "Yes, I've got the most beastly headache."
"My good Dorcas, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible.
He's always a nervous chap."
"But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself?"
He laughed with apparent enjoyment, raising his arms to heaven in mock despair, in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste.
"We will look through the desk in the boudoir first," explained John, "and go up to her bedroom afterwards.
This is Mr. Hastings...Miss Murdoch."
Lawrence Cavendish was next called.
It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in Mrs. Inglethorp's bedroom had been forced.
"My dear fellow, that's just what I want."
A slight flush rose in her face, as she answered rather constrainedly: "No."
Finally John Cavendish, finding his persuasions of no avail, went off to look up the trains.
"And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you, did she not?"
John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother's remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.
He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked.
Poirot and I had, of course already seen it.
That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you.
I mused, won over to Poirot's views for the moment, although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one.
It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again."
"That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss Howard.
"Well, it's just this, sir.
It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact."
A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she proffered to Nibs, who waved her towards Cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark: "I'm not really here today."
I didn't know it was of any importance."
On September 15th John Cavendish appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey, charged with "The Wilful Murder of Emily Agnes Inglethorp," and pleaded "Not Guilty."
Probably a judicious mixture of both.
That woman, Hastings, has got brains as well as a heart."
I had an idea...but clearly I was mistaken.
"For, if the case against him is true, how could he defend himself except by silence?"
The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered.
Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind, she heated up her cocoa, and drank it off then and there.
"There is a lady below, asking for Mr Hastings."
If I'm convinced he did it, it doesn't matter a jot to me how he did it."
John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me out to the car.
How soon, and how contemptuously, I had dismissed it from my mind.
Poirot caught me violently by the shoulders.
And he leered more jocosely than ever.
Poirot hurried to explain himself.
The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical strychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins.
To my intense surprise, Cynthia burst out laughing, and called me a 'funny dear.'
"Then," I said, "what do you deduce?"
"Come, will you not walk back with us too, Monsieur Poirot?"
There was an expression of exultation on his face which I could not understand.
One of them Belgies from the village?"
One fact leads to another...so we continue.
Nothing can bring her back to life, but we do hope, if there has been foul play, to bring the murderer to justice."
You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist's shop?"
Still, you waited to be alone before gratifying that 'interest' of yours?"
I was on a different footing.
"That's a pretty girl," I remarked appreciatively.
The spacing of the plants, also, is perfect.
With a faint gesture of the hand, he indicated the figure on the bed.
I stepped briskly down the stairs.
Now let us turn to other aspects of the case.
"Dear me, Poirot," I said with a sigh, "I think you have explained everything.
Remember, this young Mace had never actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp.
Dr. Wilkins corroborated it on all points.
"No one need sit up.
He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task.
"And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case?"
I'll admit that it wasn't he who bought strychnine at the chemist's shop.
About a quarter to seven, Mrs. Inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night.
I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp's determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon, and that therefore the quarrel took place after, and not before the making of the will.
"Well," I said, with a sigh, "we will acquit Miss Howard, then.
My system is based on his...though of course I have progressed rather further.
He has been a most famous detective."
This is an exact reproduction of it:...
There he installed me in a chair, and I related the whole story, keeping back nothing, and omitting no circumstance, however insignificant, whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet.
Well, I will tell you this.
"My dear Hastings, I don't mind telling you that I'm at my wit's end for money."
She was anxious to find some stamps, and, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk.
He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there!"
"It never entered my head."
"But it is an idea, that!"
Never, he said, in the course of his long experience, had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence.
She is up at five every morning to milk, and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime.
She was very pale, but smiling.
"We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind of fit.
He had stood aside, and as I went out I had seen the look in Mary's eyes, as John Cavendish had caught his wife in his arms.
She was obviously upset, and it had taken her appetite away.
I followed John's example, and went out into the hall, where Miss Howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head.
But there's John...and Miss Howard, surely they were speaking the truth?"
"That is exactly what I asked myself.
I confess that I was surprised by Lawrence's attitude.
John and Lawrence were in the dining-room.
"I should put it this way.
"Still, it would be interesting to know."
To which Mrs. Inglethorp replied: "My dear Mary, it has nothing to do with that matter."
"What were you doing there?"
He's welcome to her money."
But I'm not a nurse, thank heaven, I work in the dispensary."
We must break in the door.
I shall go round the long way through the woods."
"A most admirable sentiment," remarked Poirot, rising briskly to his feet.
